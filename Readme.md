Graph algorithms like BFS, DFS, and Dijkstra can be challenging to understand and analyze. With TraverseTech Explorer, we aim to bridge the gap between theory and practice, making these complex algorithms more intuitive and accessible.

🔍 Key Features:
✨ Visualize graph algorithms such as BFS, DFS, and Dijkstra in an interactive and user-friendly interface.
✨ Build custom graphs using a robust toolbar with options to:

Add vertices and edges.
Remove edges.
Edit edge weights.
✨ Run and observe algorithms on your customized graphs to deepen understanding.
This tool is not only a powerful resource for students and educators but also demonstrates how interactive visualizations can simplify learning complex concepts.
